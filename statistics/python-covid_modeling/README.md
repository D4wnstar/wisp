A statistical analysis of COVID-19 contagion gathered by the Italian Civil Defense during the pandemic. The data is first visualized as a time series. The logistic and Gompertz statistical distributions are then employed using Bayesian statistics to figure out which best fits the temporal advancement of contagions in an early subset of the data. Parameter estimation for the models is carried out using the `emcee` Python package for Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Those models are then analyzed using data from further in time to check their validity and precision.

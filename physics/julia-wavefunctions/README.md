A simulation of a couple of simple quantum systems, the free particle and the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). The QHO simulations provide a plot of the first few eigenstates and an animation of the time evolution of a mixed state. The free particle simulations show the time evolution of a 1D and 2D free particle using a starting Gaussian wavepacket.

All the plotted results are under `plots`. Each script can be used individually by running `julia file_name.jl` if you have all necessary packages in the global environment or by opening the REPL using `julia` and running `include("file_name")` if you want to instantiate a new environment. The `main.jl` script just runs every other script.

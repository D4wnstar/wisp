Visualizations of a few fractals using [turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) by recursively breaking a line down into smaller segments according to a segmentation rule. Based on the concept of [Lindermayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).

All the plotted results are under `plots`. Each script can be used individually by running `julia file_name.jl` if you have all necessary packages in the global environment or by opening the REPL using `julia` and running `include("file_name")` if you want to instantiate a new environment. The `main.jl` script just runs every other script.

Project done in December 2024.
